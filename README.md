# Façade Fire Behavior Testing Apparatus

Welcome to the repository for our integrated laboratory-scale apparatus designed for façade fire testing. 
This experimental rig incorporates advanced tools such as mass balances, a thermal camera system, a cross-sectional camera, and a cone calorimeter system, all supported by a robust aluminum profile mainframe. 
The apparatus enables comprehensive measurement of critical parameters, including mass loss rate, temperature profiles, impingement phenomena, material decomposition, and heat release rate.

Key Features:
- Mass Balance System: Captures the mass loss rate of decomposing materials, including dripping phenomena.
- Thermal and Cross-Sectional Cameras: Provide detailed visual and thermal data.
- Cone Calorimeter System: Uses the oxygen consumption principle to determine the heat release rate.

Our research has shown that the heat release rate, mass reduction, and dripping mass measurements can be influenced by varying the position and intensity of the diffusion flame source. 
This project aims to enhance the understanding of building façade fire behavior through precise and reliable testing.
